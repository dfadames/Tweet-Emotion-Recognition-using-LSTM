# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-using-LSTM
This repository contains a project for training and using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to classify emotions in tweets. (from twitter/X)) 
The model identifies emotions such as sadness, joy, love, and anger based on textual input, leveraging the PyTorch framework and the BERT tokenizer.

Trained from a dataset from:
